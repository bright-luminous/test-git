      <h1>Who we are</h2>
      <p>We are one of the teams from computer innovation engineering who creating a program as our semester project. Our team composed of four people: Chic, Plam, Punch, and Kavin. We are all freshman-year and this is our first project of this scale. It may not come out as beautiful as we want it to be, but we will make sure it at least work.</p>

      <h1>Why this program</h1>
      <p>This idea of bill splitting program is chiefly from the inconvenience we face when we hang out together. Image 10 people walk into a restaurant and each person orders separately. once the meal is done they want to pay separately, but nobody remembers what they have ordered. Yes, that us every time we hang out. This program aims to be the notepad that keeps track of what each person orders and calculate the bill for everyone.</p>
